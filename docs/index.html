    <!-- SUMMARY -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Gratitude Garden is a wellbeing-focused Android application that explores
            gratitude journaling in a calm and non-competitive way. Instead of using
            streaks, statistics, or performance metrics, the app visualises emotional
            reflection through the gradual growth of a single plant.
        </p>

    <!-- CONCEPT -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>
            The core concept of Gratitude Garden is to represent gratitude as a slow,
            organic process rather than a measurable achievement. Each gratitude entry
            contributes to the growth of one plant, which evolves through predefined
            stages over time.
        </p>
        <p>
            This metaphor avoids pressure and competition and encourages mindful,
            low-threshold reflection. The plant acts as a visual companion rather than
            a goal to optimise.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- IDEA & MOTIVATION -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Idea & Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            Many existing gratitude apps rely heavily on text, statistics, or streaks,
            which can feel overwhelming or discouraging. Gratitude Garden was designed
            to support emotional wellbeing without performance pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
            By focusing on calm visuals and slow progression, the app encourages users
            to reflect at their own pace and build a sustainable habit.
