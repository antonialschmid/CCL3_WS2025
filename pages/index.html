    <h2>Concept</h2>
    <p>
        Gratitude Garden is a wellbeing-focused Android app that explores
        gratitude journaling in a calm and low-pressure way. The project was
        developed as part of Creative Coding Lab 3 and uses a single plant as
        a visual metaphor for emotional growth and reflection.
    </p>

    <p>
        Many existing gratitude apps rely heavily on text, statistics, or
        streak-based systems, which can feel repetitive or stressful for
        users. Gratitude Garden takes a different approach by visualising
        progress through the gradual growth of one plant, without creating
        competition or performance pressure.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each gratitude entry contributes to the plant’s development, moving
        through predefined growth stages over time. The focus of the app is
        not productivity, but mindful reflection and emotional awareness.
        The plant serves as a gentle companion that represents the user’s
        personal gratitude journey.
    </p>

<!-- Idea & Motivation -->
<section id="idea" class="section">
    <h2>Idea &amp; Motivation</h2>
    <p>
        Many people struggle to maintain a regular gratitude journaling habit.
        Existing solutions often feel rigid or competitive. Gratitude Garden
        was created to allow reflection without pressure, using simple
        visual evolution.
    </p>
    <p>
        By visualising emotional progress as plant growth, the app supports
        emotional wellbeing rather than productivity tracking. This concept
        encourages users to reflect in a calm and aesthetic way.
    </p>

<!-- Implementation -->
<section id="implementation" class="section">
    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p>
        The app is built for the Android platform using Kotlin and follows
        the MVVM architecture pattern. Data is stored locally via Room
        (SQLite) to ensure privacy and usability without internet access.
    </p>
    <p>
        The interface consists of a garden view with one central plant,
        a screen to add daily entries, and a calendar view showing past
        contributions.
    </p>

<!-- App Structure -->
<section id="structure" class="section">
    <h2>App Structure</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Garden (Home Screen)</li>
        <li>Add Entry</li>
        <li>History / Calendar</li>
        <li>Entry Detail</li>
        <li>Stats / Settings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Navigation is simple, using a bottom navigation bar to reduce cognitive
        load and support a calm user experience.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- Technical Overview -->
<section id="tech" class="section">
    <h2>Technical Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The project is implemented using Kotlin (Android) with an MVVM
        architecture, Room for local persistence, and a focus on offline-first
        usability.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data such as entries and plant stage are stored locally, preserving
        privacy and enabling use without an internet connection.
    </p>

    <h2>User Test Plan</h2>

    <p>
        To evaluate the usability and clarity of the <strong>Gratitude Garden</strong> app,
        a structured user test plan was developed. The goal of the evaluation is to
        identify usability issues early, assess the comprehensibility of interactions,
        and validate design decisions.
    </p>


    <h3>1. Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
    <p>
        Before conducting user tests, a heuristic evaluation was performed on the
        initial prototype. The evaluation was based on common usability heuristics
        such as visibility of system status, consistency, error prevention, and user control,
        as discussed in UEE.
    </p>

    <h4>Strengths</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Clear visual hierarchy and consistent styling across screens.</li>
        <li>Navigation structure (Garden, Add Entry, History) is easy to understand.</li>
        <li>Visual feedback (colors, highlights, calendar dots) supports orientation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Identified Usability Issues</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Some interactions (e.g. date selection via calendar or month dropdown) may not be immediately obvious.</li>
        <li>Icons without text labels rely on prior user familiarity.</li>
        <li>The calendar view may require explanation for first-time users.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These findings informed the design of the user test tasks and research questions.
    </p>


    <h3>2. Initial Hypotheses &amp; Research Questions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>H1:</strong> Users can navigate between Garden, History, and Add Entry without external help.</li>
        <li><strong>H2:</strong> Users understand how to add a new gratitude entry, including selecting a date and mood.</li>
        <li><strong>H3:</strong> Users can interpret the calendar and its visual indicators (dots, colors, highlights).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Additional exploratory questions include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Q1:</strong> Do users understand the meaning of colored calendar days and rings?</li>
        <li><strong>Q2:</strong> At which points do users feel uncertain or confused?</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>3. Data to Collect</h3>
    <p>
        Both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected during the usability test.
    </p>

    <h4>Quantitative Data</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Task completion rate (completed / not completed)</li>
        <li>Time on task</li>
        <li>Number of errors or incorrect interactions</li>
        <li>Questionnaire results (e.g. SUS or short Likert-scale questions)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Qualitative Data</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>User comments during and after tasks</li>
        <li>Observed hesitation or confusion</li>
        <li>Open-ended feedback on design and interaction</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>4. Methods, Tasks &amp; Materials</h3>

    <h4>Method</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Moderated usability test using the think-aloud method</li>
        <li>Within-subject design (all participants perform the same tasks)</li>
        <li>Small sample size suitable for early-stage design evaluation</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Navigate to the Garden screen and explain what is visible.</li>
        <li>Add a new gratitude entry for today.</li>
        <li>Change the date of an entry.</li>
        <li>Navigate to History and find an entry from another month.</li>
        <li>Open an existing entry and describe its content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Materials</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Interactive prototype / running app</li>
        <li>SUS questionnaire</li>
        <li>Observation notes taken by the evaluator</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>5. Timing &amp; Iteration</h3>
    <p>
        The usability test may be conducted either early during the Creative Coding Lab
        to identify major usability issues, or later before the final presentation to
        validate the refined design.
    </p>

    <!-- Participants -->
    <h3>6. Participants</h3>
    <p>
        The test will be conducted with at least five participants. Participants are
        young adults aged approximately 20–35 and regular smartphone users.
        None of the participants will have prior experience with the Gratitude Garden app.
    </p>

    <!-- Procedure -->
    <h3>7. Procedure</h3>
    <p>
        The usability test will be conducted as a moderated, in-person session lasting
        approximately 10–20 minutes.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Introduction and consent</li>
        <li>Execution of predefined tasks</li>
        <li>Completion of a short questionnaire (SUS)</li>
        <li>Open feedback discussion</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        During the test, observations will focus on task success, hesitation, errors,
        and user comments.
