    <h1>Usability Evaluation</h1>

    <!-- 1. USABILITY TEST PLAN -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>1. Usability Test Plan</h2>

        <p>
            This evaluation assesses the effectiveness, learnability, and user satisfaction
            of <strong>Gratitude Garden</strong>, an Android app focused on calm and reflective
            gratitude journaling.
        </p>

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Verify that users can complete core workflows successfully.</li>
            <li>Identify potential learnability issues for first-time users.</li>
            <li>Measure perceived usability using the System Usability Scale (SUS).</li>
            <li>Identify usability issues using Nielsen’s heuristics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Heuristic evaluation of the initial prototype.</li>
            <li>Moderated user test with task-based protocol and think-aloud method.</li>
            <li>Post-test SUS questionnaire.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. HEURISTIC EVALUATION -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>2. Heuristic Evaluation (Initial Prototype)</h2>

        <p>
            A heuristic evaluation was conducted on the initial prototype using common usability
            heuristics discussed in EMH-UEE, including visibility of system status, consistency,
            error prevention, and user control.
        </p>

        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Clear visual hierarchy and consistent styling across screens.</li>
            <li>Navigation structure (Garden, Add Entry, History) is easy to understand.</li>
            <li>Visual feedback (colors, highlights, calendar dots) supports orientation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Identified Usability Issues</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Date selection via calendar or month dropdown is not immediately obvious.</li>
            <li>Icons without text labels rely on prior user familiarity.</li>
            <li>The calendar visualization may require explanation for first-time users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Methods Used</h2>

        <p>
            The usability test was conducted as a moderated, in-person test using a think-aloud
            protocol. All participants completed the same set of tasks (within-subject design).
        </p>

        <h3>Participants</h3>
        <p>
            The test was conducted with <strong>5 participants</strong>, aged approximately 20–35.
            All participants were regular smartphone users and had no prior experience with the app.
        </p>

        <h3>Tasks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Navigate to the Garden screen and explain what is visible.</li>
