        <h2>Antonia Schmid</h2>
        <p>
            Working on Gratitude Garden was a very valuable experience for me. This project helped me deepen my understanding of user-centered design, combining design, development, and evaluation. And all of it was, to be honest, very fun.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong >What went well?</strong>
            The core concept of the app was implemented well, I would say. We stayed almost true to the design, and the visual metaphor of the plant growth was well received by our test users and easy to understand. The general design (which I really like and I am very proud of) was liked a lot by the users, and the app structure seemed intuitive during the testing. The collaboration within the team worked smoothly, and I have to say Kathrin and I did a pretty good job working together, although in the beginning we struggled with GitHub and coding at the same time on the project. But we started to do a split-up of time, and after we started to work and take turns, all the Git commits were merged perfectly in the main branch.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What went wrong?</strong>
            To be honest, nothing went really wrong, we only had a few challenges. As I said before, GitHub was in the beginning a challenge, but we worked it out. Managing state correctly across screens (especially dates and edit flows) was challenging. And the biggest problem was the circle with the dates on the Garden screen, which was our major problem and which we literally could not fix until the end. We wanted it to open the entry from the date you clicked on, but it was not possible for us to find a solution, so now it opens the History screen, which I guess is okay.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Usability Testing: </strong>
            The usability test confirmed that the app is easy to learn and pleasant to use. We had a pretty high SUS score, but in the end this is based on testing with only six people, and all study with us, so maybe this is not the best insight, but for this kind of testing this is okay, of course. Some users were unsure about the mood selection and the colors we used, because it wasn’t really clear if a mood was selected or not. Almost all users came across this problem, so we fixed it after the user testing. A few other problems occurred which we fixed, but they were mainly minor issues.
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong>My personal learning outcome:</strong> 
           Of course, my understanding of Android app architecture and Kotlin improved. The CCLs always help me understand the whole semester better. And it was nice to have this first-hand experience of user testing, this time on our own app. I really started to understand how errors and problems can appear, and how even apps that have existed for a long time can still have issues. It was also interesting to see how differently people approach and interact with our app. You always plan out the user flow, but you are so fixed on this setup that when somebody else starts using the app and does things differently, you finally see problems or where the planned user flow isn’t working.
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong>What could be improved or worked on if we had more time?</strong>
            I think this app could have a few more features if we had more time. For example, I would have really liked a bigger garden where more plants grow, and maybe some animations so you really get the feeling of nurturing and caring for your garden. We would also refine accessibility aspects, of course. I would also be interested in a more personalized app design, for example changing the plants you plant or the color of the app based on the time of the year or day and night. In the end, it would be interesting to see long-term usability testing and feedback from people who would use this app daily, and how their mental health and general gratitude might change over time. And one last point: because I don’t use an Android phone, I would like to code this app for iPhone so I could use it myself.

        <p>
            Through the Gratitude Garden project, I learned how an idea can slowly turn into a working app. I especially understood better how design decisions affect how users experience and use the app.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What went well?</strong>
            One thing that helped us a lot during the project was user testing. Getting feedback showed us that some things we thought were obvious were actually confusing for users. This helped us see where changes were needed, and we improved several parts of the app to make them clearer and easier to use.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also really enjoyed working in pairs. Collaborating made it easier to exchange ideas, discuss solutions, and support each other during difficult parts of the development. Even though working with Git was sometimes confusing, especially at the beginning, we learned how to handle it better over time and improved our workflow.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What went wrong?</strong>
            Some parts of the app were harder to implement than I expected. One example was the circle with the dots on the Garden screen, which I tried to make clickable multiple times, but it never worked as intended. In the end, I decided to change the approach and made the whole area clickable instead. Even though this was frustrating at times, it helped me learn when it is better to stop forcing a solution and adapt the idea to what is technically possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Usability Testing:</strong>
            The usability testing was one of the most valuable parts of the project. Seeing real users interact with the app showed us problems we would not have noticed on our own. The feedback helped us improve clarity, especially in areas like mood selection and navigation, and confirmed that the overall concept was easy to understand.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>My personal learning outcome:</strong>
            Through this project, I improved my technical skills in Kotlin and Jetpack Compose and became more confident working with Android app development. At the same time, I gained a much better understanding of user-centered design. I learned that users often interact with an app in ways you do not expect, even if the design seems clear to the developer. Because of this, usability testing and user feedback turned out to be extremely important. They helped us notice problems we would not have seen on our own and showed us how small changes can make a big difference for the overall user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What could be improved with more time?</strong>
            With more time, I would focus on improving small details, accessibility, and making the app more interactive and playful, so users feel more connected to it. Adding more visual feedback or simple animations could make the experience feel more alive. It would also be interesting to test the app over a longer period with more users to better understand long-term usability and how people actually use it in their daily lives.
