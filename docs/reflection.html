            Working on Gratitude Garden was a very valuable experience for me. This project helped me deepen my understanding of user-centered design, combining design, development, and evaluation. And all of it was, to be honest, very fun.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong >What went well?</strong> The core concept of the app was implemented well, I would say. We stayed almost true to the design, and the visual metaphor of the plant growth was well received by our test users and easy to understand. The general design (which I really like and I am very proud of) was liked a lot by the users, and the app structure seemed intuitive during the testing. The collaboration within the team worked smoothly, and I have to say Kathrin and I did a pretty good job working together, although in the beginning we struggled with GitHub and coding at the same time on the project. But we started to do a split-up of time, and after we started to work and take turns, all the Git commits were merged perfectly in the main branch.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What went wrong?</strong>To be honest, nothing went really wrong, we only had a few challenges. As I said before, GitHub was in the beginning a challenge, but we worked it out. Managing state correctly across screens (especially dates and edit flows) was challenging. And the biggest problem was the circle with the dates on the Garden screen, which was our major problem and which we literally could not fix until the end. We wanted it to open the entry from the date you clicked on, but it was not possible for us to find a solution, so now it opens the History screen, which I guess is okay.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Usability Testing: </strong> The usability test confirmed that the app is easy to learn and pleasant to use. We had a pretty high SUS score, but in the end this is based on testing with only six people, and all study with us, so maybe this is not the best insight, but for this kind of testing this is okay, of course. Some users were unsure about the mood selection and the colors we used, because it wasn’t really clear if a mood was selected or not. Almost all users came across this problem, so we fixed it after the user testing. A few other problems occurred which we fixed, but they were mainly minor issues.
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong>My personal learning outcome:</strong>  Of course, my understanding of Android app architecture and Kotlin improved. The CCLs always help me understand the whole semester better. And it was nice to have this first-hand experience of user testing, this time on our own app. I really started to understand how errors and problems can appear, and how even apps that have existed for a long time can still have issues. It was also interesting to see how differently people approach and interact with our app. You always plan out the user flow, but you are so fixed on this setup that when somebody else starts using the app and does things differently, you finally see problems or where the planned user flow isn’t working.

           <strong>What could be improved or worked on if we had more time?</strong>


            I think this app could have a few more features if we had more time. For example, I would have really liked a bigger garden where more plants grow, and maybe some animations so you really get the feeling of nurturing and caring for your garden. We would also refine accessibility aspects, of course. I would also be interested in a more personalized app design, for example changing the plants you plant or the color of the app based on the time of the year or day and night. In the end, it would be interesting to see long-term usability testing and feedback from people who would use this app daily, and how their mental health and general gratitude might change over time. And one last point: because I don’t use an Android phone, I would like to code this app for iPhone so I could use it myself.
