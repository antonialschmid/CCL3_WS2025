    <h2>Concept</h2>
    <p>
        Gratitude Garden is a wellbeing-focused Android app that explores
        gratitude journaling in a calm and low-pressure way. The project was
        developed as part of Creative Coding Lab 3 and uses a single plant as
        a visual metaphor for emotional growth and reflection.
    </p>

    <p>
        Many existing gratitude apps rely heavily on text, statistics, or
        streak-based systems, which can feel repetitive or stressful for
        users. Gratitude Garden takes a different approach by visualising
        progress through the gradual growth of one plant, without creating
        competition or performance pressure.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each gratitude entry contributes to the plant’s development, moving
        through predefined growth stages over time. The focus of the app is
        not productivity, but mindful reflection and emotional awareness.
        The plant serves as a gentle companion that represents the user’s
        personal gratitude journey.

<!-- Idea & Motivation -->
<section id="idea" class="section">
    <h2>Idea &amp; Motivation</h2>
    <p>
        Many people struggle to maintain a regular gratitude journaling habit.
        Existing solutions often feel rigid or competitive. Gratitude Garden
        was created to allow reflection without pressure, using simple
        visual evolution.
    </p>
    <p>
        By visualising emotional progress as plant growth, the app supports
        emotional wellbeing rather than productivity tracking. This concept
        encourages users to reflect in a calm and aesthetic way.

<!-- Implementation -->
<section id="implementation" class="section">
    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p>
        The app is built for the Android platform using Kotlin and follows
        the MVVM architecture pattern. Data is stored locally via Room
        (SQLite) to ensure privacy and usability without internet access.
    </p>
    <p>
        The interface consists of a garden view with one central plant,
        a screen to add daily entries, and a calendar view showing past
        contributions.

<!-- Technical Overview -->
<section id="tech" class="section">
    <h2>Technical Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The project is implemented using Kotlin (Android) with an MVVM
        architecture, Room for local persistence, and a focus on offline-first
        usability.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data such as entries and plant stage are stored locally, preserving
        privacy and enabling use without an internet connection.
